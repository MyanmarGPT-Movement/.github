# MyanmarGPT-Movement (မြန်မာ့အေအိုင်လှုပ်ရှားမှု)
## AI Movement in Myanmar initiated by Myanmar GPT 

### The start of MyanmarGPT-Movement ([ဗမာလိုအသေးစိတ်ဖတ်ရန်](https://github.com/MyanmarGPT-Movement/MyanmarGPT-Movement))

MyanmarGPT Movement is a movement for Artificial Intelligence in Myanmar.
The Movement was initiated by the release of MyanmarGPT, a Burmese language GPT in 2023.

After the release of the first open-source, usable foundational Burmese language in Myanmar, I, [Min Si Thu](https://github.com/MinSiThu) feel like we need to move further in the field of Artificial Intelligence to explore more and more machine learning models, projects, datasets and activities in Myanmar.

Thus, why I started a movement on Artificial Intelligence, named after MyanmarGPT, which has several impacts and influences on the local communities in Myanmar.

### How the MyanmarGPT Movement works
